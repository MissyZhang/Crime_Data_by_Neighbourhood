# Overview of the report

The project analyzed crime rate data in Toronto neighborhoods obtained from the Toronto Police Service Annual Statistical Report (ASR) between the years 2017 and 2021. The data was analyzed using the R statistical programming language and various R packages such as tidyverse, tidyr, and dplyr. The report found that crime rates in different categories showed varying trends over the years, with assault having the highest rate while homicide had the lowest and remained stable. The report also found that crime rates varied by neighborhood size but did not have a direct relationship with population.
